block chain uses hashing, this hashing creates unique hash codes for every block,
each block has it's own data which comprises of columns like 
*Block number
1> NONCE
2>data
3>Prev
4>hash

Now each block has subblocks
and these blocks are distributed(Copied) on many systems at the same time,so alteration can affect the validity of blocks

Blocks also have a token column where each (token column)tx: represents a ledger(transactions of money)

The smart contracts is put in this data section is used !

The question is how you put in the money in the system and validation

so first two terms that we need to learn
1> Private key  :"Only known to the key holder, is used to sign transactions"

2> Public key   :"Used to verify the transactions"

You make a transaction , sign it , with your public key, and the transaction  is passed on to the other blocks with a signature.
Eth uses (Elleptical Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) .
This signature can verify that it is from you , by verifying your public key,you cant derive private key from this.

This is how a transactions work in a blockchain. 
And these peers or nodes in a block chain with instances of your transactions verify it thus taking a little from the transactions (Gas) in etherium
to do this.

With this there are few terms like Oracles that are data of these blocks
Smart Contracts
will cover it on DAY2...
